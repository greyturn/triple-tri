# Triple Tri

A project for fun to try and replicate and extend the minigame from various Final Fantasy games, [Triple Triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Triad).

## Dev

First, create an dev env file: `.env.development`. In it add:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV=development
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Technologies

Built on React and NextJS.

Styling via [Pigment CSS](https://github.com/mui/pigment-css)

Hosted on Vercel.
